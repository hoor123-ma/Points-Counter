# points_counter_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

ðŸš€ Itâ€™s a Points Counter App, and hereâ€™s what it does:

âœ… Each team (Team 1 and Team 2) can add points:

Add 1 Point 
Add 2 Points
Add 3 Points

âœ… Thereâ€™s also a Reset Button to reset the score and start fresh!

Itâ€™s a simple app, but itâ€™s my first step toward becoming a Flutter developer. I learned a lot while building it, and Iâ€™m looking forward to creating more projects and improving my skills.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
